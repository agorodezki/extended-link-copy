        <li>
            <strong>Regex: </strong>
            A regex that describes the part of a href in Javascript notation. See
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp">here.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Compose: </strong>
            If you have set capturing groups in your regex you can access them with ${n} in this field.
            The n stands for a number greater 0. With ${0} you get the hole match of the regex.
            With ${1} you get the content of the first capturing group, with ${2} the content of the second, and so on.
            Everything else you're writing to this field would be assumed to the resulting string.
            If you leave this field empty the hole match of the regex would be assumed to the resulting string.
            See examples below or <a href="https://github.com/agorodezki/extended-link-copy">on Github.</a>
